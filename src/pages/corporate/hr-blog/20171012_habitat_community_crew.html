      <p class="lead">This month, we celebrate the second anniversary of our October SERVE initiative &mdash; 31 days where the Freddie Mac <a href="http://www.freddiemac.com/about/communities/community-crew.html">Community Crew</a> volunteers support our important housing mission by giving freely of their time and talents in our communities.</p>
      <p>During this month's SERVE, we continue our long tradition of working with Habitat for Humanity to create a safe and affordable place for families to call home. We're also shining a spotlight on the Women Build: She Nailed it! campaign, which raises awareness about low- and moderate-income women in need of affordable housing.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.dchabitat.org/events/women-build/" rel="external">Women Build</a> was started by a small, committed group of women in Charlotte, N.C., in 1991 and continues to grow around the world, empowering women everywhere to proactively address housing needs for themselves, their families and their neighbors. Freddie Mac and its Women's Interactive Network are proud to support this important initiative and help local families realize the dream of homeownership. <strong>By partnering with DC Habitat for Humanity on the Women Build today, we're providing a hand up &ndash; not a handout &ndash; that encourages families to build strong, stable and bright futures. &nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p>The Women Build &ndash; and all our events during October &ndash; offer the people of Freddie Mac a unique opportunity to not just carry out our mission, but to also give back to our local communities. Being more firmly rooted in our communities is a bond that makes us a better company and a better neighbor.</p>
      <p>To all the volunteers and nonprofits who make a difference every day we say, "Thank you!"</p>
