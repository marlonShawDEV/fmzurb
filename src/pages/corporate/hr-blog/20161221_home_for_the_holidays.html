      <p>Year-round, our Community Crew volunteers give back in the communities where they live and work. They give their time and talent freely, in all of the communities Freddie Mac serves to make a positive impact in the lives of America's families, including Andrea Morgan.</p>
      <p>Last year, Andrea's dreams came true when <a href="http://www.freddiemac.com/blog/notable/20161006_in_your_community.html">Freddie Mac's Community Crew</a> and Habitat for Humanity came together to build her first home &ndash; just in time for the holidays. In addition to having enough space for her children, she now has a <em>home</em> where she can gather loved ones for the holidays and give them something to remember.</p>
      <p><em>"As I look back over the one year that I've been in my house, the changes my family has made are so remarkable." &ndash; Andrea</em></p>

      <p>Home and family are at the heart of what we do at Freddie Mac and we're grateful to be able to change people's lives for the better.</p>
      <p>Our commitment to America's families extends way beyond the holidays. We're building a better Freddie Mac and a better housing finance system that is <a href="http://www.freddiemac.com/corporate/movinghousingforward/">moving housing forward</a> every day.</p>
