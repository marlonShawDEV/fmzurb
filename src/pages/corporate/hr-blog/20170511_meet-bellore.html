      <p>"I like forging new territory and dealing with large initiatives," Bellore says. He's certainly doing that today as the lead for integrating the industry-transforming <a href="http://www.freddiemac.com/mbs/html/single_security_csp.html">Common Securitization Platform</a> (CSP) within Freddie Mac's securities operations.</p>
      <p>An initiative like the CSP, which will allow the GSEs to issue a common security, has never been tried before. The stakes are very high. That's when you need people you can trust to get the job done right.</p>
      <p>Born and raised in India, Bellore is no stranger to taking calculated risks before setting out on a new adventure. After earning degrees in computer science management, he became a software developer with a large corporation. His work often took him to the United States, and his visits convinced him to move here. He became a consultant for an insurance software company. But after several years of nearly 100 percent travel, he wanted a change.</p>
      <p>Bellore joined Freddie Mac in 2002. He was surprised, he says, by how long many of the employees he met had worked here and the pride they felt about it. "After so many years consulting, I wondered how it was possible to be in the same place for so long," he says. "But now I understand. I'm still enjoying myself after all these years."</p>
      <p>Bellore continues: "Learning from others and working in teams towards something with long-lasting implications is enjoyable for me. And having management's belief in me always motivates me to do more."</p>
