      <p>At Freddie Mac, we value our inclusive environment and continue to strengthen our workforce by identifying top talent and giving them the opportunity to be their best. </p>
      <h2>Finding the Best and Brightest Talent</h2>
 
      <p>Finding the top talent from a diverse talent pool is a top priority in helping Freddie Mac give more to the communities we serve. We provide our executives and hiring managers the tools they need to ensure that diversity is a core component of our recruiting process. In order to cast the widest net possible during our talent search, we partner with diverse organizations to identify the best and brightest to bring their talents to Freddie Mac.</p>
 
      <h2>More Happens for Your Career</h2>
 
      <p>We’ve built our success by developing our top performers. Providing our employees more opportunities to grow their career is our secret to keeping our talented and diverse workforce at Freddie Mac. Through Freddie Mac University, we offer hundreds of instructor-led and online courses to help employees strengthen their skills and get ahead. We also offer tuition assistance for pursuit of undergraduate and graduate degree, and additional specialized training. Our commitment to diversity is total, from entry-level to executive positions. </p> 
 
      <h2>A Workplace You Can Call Home</h2>
 
      <p>Fostering an inclusive environment with a strong sense of community is important to creating an engaged workforce. Our nine employee resource groups (ERGs) work together to support our business goals, give back to the community, and provide employees a powerful professional network. The groups also offer employees year-round opportunities for learning, networking, mentoring, and cultural enrichment.</p>
    
      <p class="intro">At Freddie Mac, we foster an environment that lets our people be at their best. In return, they drive the housing industry forward with innovation, determination and a passion for our mission.</p>
