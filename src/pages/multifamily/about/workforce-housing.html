          <p class="lead">Freddie Mac Multifamily is committed to promoting rental housing affordability. This comes through in our support for workforce housing.</p>
          <h3>What Is Workforce Housing? </h3>
          <p class="no-margin">Our definition:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Privately-owned and -operated properties
               <ul>
                <li>With limited amenities</li>
                <li>That are affordable to renters with lower incomes (for example, firefighters, teachers, service and hourly wage workers, young families …)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Any property type, but most often <a href="#">garden style</a></li>
            <li>Typically at least 15 years old</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Where Is It?</h3>
          <p>Everywhere, especially near employment centers and urban areas.</p>
    
          <h3>How Does Freddie Mac Multifamily Support It?</h3>
          <p>We help property owners/developers buy, refinance, and preserve multifamily rental properties. To do this, we work with approved seller/servicers to fund loans ranging from $1 million to $100s of millions for property types and sizes – from five to hundreds of units, one building to many.</p>
          <p>Within the last few years, we’ve expanded our support for workforce housing to include funding small balance loans ($1 million to $6 million; up to $7.5 million in high-cost areas) on small properties (five to 50 units) and on manufactured housing communities (MHCs). With Freddie Mac Multifamily’s involvement, we’ve brought more funding, consistency, and stability to this important segment.</p>
    
          <h3>Why Is It Important?</h3>
          <p>Around half of all renters are cost-burdened, meaning that they spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing. The burden is much heavier for many lower-income households. And when more of their income must go toward housing, they have less to spend on other necessities – like food, clothing, and health care – let alone to save or to spend elsewhere.</p>
          <p>So, while we’ve always supported affordability, housing for this part of the population has become more of a focus for us. And the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), our conservator, agrees. Much of our funding for workforce housing is excluded from the purchase-volume cap that FHFA sets for us each year. We’re proud to support renters nationwide, and to help improve their quality of life.</p>
