      <p>K-Deals feature a range of investor options with stable cash flows and a structured credit enhancement. K-Deals include guaranteed senior and interest only classes. The related underlying private label trust includes unguaranteed mezzanine, subordinate and interest only bonds.</p>
      <p>Freddie Mac works diligently to manage the terms and credit quality of the underlying loans and the composition of the securities. In addition, there are strict prepayment restrictions on the underlying collateral which reduces the interest rate sensitivity of the K Certificates.</p>
      <h3 class="section-subtitle weight-medium">Freddie Mac Fixed Rate K-Series Structural Enhancement</h3>
      <p>We are making a programmatic change to the certificate structure on our fixed rate, multi-borrower K-series multifamily mortgage-backed securities. These K-series issuances will typically include two new classes of structured pass-through certificates (SPCs): Class A-M and Class XAM. More information can be found <a href="/multifamily/pdf/k_deal_fixed_rate_structural_enhancement.pdf">here</a>.</p>
      <h2>General Structure</h2>
      <p>Freddie Mac securitizes Multifamily loans via the K Certificate structure through the following steps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>First, the loans are sold to a third-party depositor who deposits the loans into a third-party trust.</li>
        <li>Then private label securities backed by the loans are issued by the third-party trust.</li>
        <li>The subordinate bonds and mezzanine bonds, which are not guaranteed by Freddie Mac, are issued by the third-party trust and are privately offered to third-party investors.</li>
        <li>Freddie Mac purchases all the senior, guaranteed bonds issued by the third-party trust and securitizes the senior bonds via a Freddie Mac trust.</li>
        <li>The resulting Freddie Mac guaranteed structured pass-through certificates (&ldquo;K Certificates&rdquo;) are then publicly offered by Freddie Mac via placement agents.</li>
      </ul>
